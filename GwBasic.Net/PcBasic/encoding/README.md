PC-BASIC codepages
------------------

Numbered code pages refer to the OEM code pages as defined by Microsoft.
Where there is a numbering conflict or unclarity, names are used instead of
numbers. Numbered code pages agree with Microsoft sources in the ranges 80-FF,
where those sources are available.
Code points 00, 20-7E must map to the corresponding ASCII values.
Most code pages use the Special Graphic Characters range at 01-1F and 7F; the
mapping is at http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MISC/IBMGRAPH.TXT  

See the PC-BASIC documentation for a list of supported codepages and
their names, which agree with the file names in this directory.
